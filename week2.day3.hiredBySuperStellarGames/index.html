                        A pocket watch (or pocketwatch) is a watch that is made to be carried in a pocket, as opposed to a wristwatch, which is strapped
                        to the wrist. They were the most common type of watch from their development in the 16th century until
                        wristwatches became popular after World War I during which a transitional design, trench watches, were
                        used by the military. Pocket watches generally have an attached chain to allow them to be secured to
                        a waistcoat, lapel, or belt loop, and to prevent them from being dropped. Watches were also mounted on
                        a short leather strap or fob, when a long chain would have been cumbersome or likely to catch on things.
                        This fob could also provide a protective flap over their face and crystal. Women's watches were normally
                        of this form, with a watch fob that was more decorative than protective. Chains were frequently decorated
                        with a silver or enamel pendant, often carrying the arms of some club or society, which by association
                        also became known as a fob. Ostensibly practical gadgets such as a watch winding key, vesta case, or
                        a cigar cutter also appeared on watch chains, although usually in an overly decorated style. Also common
                        are fasteners designed to be put through a buttonhole and worn in a jacket or waistcoat, this sort being
                        frequently associated with and named after train conductors.
